# Gecko
Gecko - Graph Embeddings for Classification and Knowledge Observation 

Tools for graph analysis based on vectorizing nodes.

Useful for clustering (aka community detection), vertex nomination, link prediction and graph matching.

## Installation
Perform the following two commands:

```bash
pip3.6 install -r requirements.txt
pip3.6 install git+https://github.com/NewKnowledge/gecko
```
Alternatively, if the code is cloned locally, the second line can change to:

```bash
pip3.6 install .
```

## Examples
See the bottom of `Gecko.py` for example code that serves as demonstration of capabilities. Indeed one can do

```bash
python3.6 Gecko.py
```

without pip installing to immediately test on the simplest example (Zachary's Karate Club). 

In the `/scripts` subfolder checkout sample code for library when used in pip installable form, in CommunityDetection.py.


More detailed instructions forthcoming.
